<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sumerian/">Sumerian</a> is an Amazon Web Service that aims to easily create and run browser-based 3D, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR) applications.

To get started making a WebXR experience in Sumerian:

- Sign into your AWS account, and create a new Sumerian project from the dashboard.

- Click "Import Assets" at the top and import the VR Asset Pack into your project.

- Click "Create Entity" and add a quad from the 3D primitives list.

- Select the quad in the Entites list on the left, open its Transform component on the right, and change the X rotation to be -90 and the XYZ scale to be 10.

- From the Assets section in the bottom left, select VRCameraRig from the VR Asset Pack and drag it into your Entites list.

- With VRCameraRig selected, open its VRCameraRig component and check "CurrentVRCameraRig" to enable it.

You should now be able to run the scene and enter into immersive mode. When ready to share your project externally, you can publish it through the Publish dropdown in the top right and share the link it provides.
